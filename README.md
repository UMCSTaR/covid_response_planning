# covid_response_planning

Please use COVID Response Planner.xlsm as the active file, the naming convention is to be phased out.

The development branch contains the latest collaborative version of the spreadsheet. You should branch off of development to make updates to the spreadsheet. When you are confident that your work is completed and unit tested, coordinate with the team about merging back into development.

IMPORTANT: Do not commit directly to the development branch unless you have coordinated with everyone and ensured that all of their changes are incorporated.

When the version in the development branch is ready for release, tag it (with a version number) and merge it into master. The file in master is the file that will be uploaded to the website.
